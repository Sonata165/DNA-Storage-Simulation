# DNA Storage Synthesis
## Overview
This project aims to build data synthesize systems to contaminate the clean DNA strands, to simulate the changes of DNA brought by the write and read operation of DNA-based storage systems. Specifically, three different methods are demonstrated:
- a naïve rule-based method 
- A multi-layer perceptron network
- A sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network

To test the quality of synthesized data, double-sided Bitwise Majority Alignment (BMA) algorithm is run on both generated data and real noisy data from DNA reads. The more similar the BMA algorithm behaves, the higher the generated data quality is.

In addition to the training and evaluation code, we also demonstrate some promising results: using the generated noisy strands from our seq2seq network, the given trace reconstruction algorithm behaves very similarly as when giving the real noisy data as input.

## Result
Trace reconstruction result comparison of real data and generated data by seq2seq model:

Other numeric metric:

    Result on real data:
        Average reconstruction error rate per position: 0.1181,
        Number of perfectly reconstructed strands: 332,
    Result on synthesized data:
        Average reconstruction error rate per position: 0.1238,
        Number of perfectly reconstructed strands: 338,
        Average of positional absolute error rate difference: 0.0080

## Get started
1. If the project folder doesn't have directory 
        
        data/Microsoft_Nanopore
   Download the dataset from <a href='https://github.com/microsoft/clustered-nanopore-reads-dataset'>here</a>. After downloading, put all contents of the downloaed folder to 
        
        data/Microsoft_Nanopore/raw


2. Create a conda environment for this project, by

        conda env create -n [env_name] -f env.yaml

3. If the project folder doesn't have directory

        data/Microsoft_Nanopore/train.json
    Convert the raw data into structured format by 
        
        python format_data.py

5. There are three methods implemented for the simulation. To build the corresponding synthesis system, run one of the three commands below. **Note**: you may need to change the output directory in mlp.yaml or s2s_rnn.yaml before training a new model yourself, otherwise the existing results might be overwrote.
        
        # Build and evaluate a rule-based system
        python rule_based_method.py

        # Train, inference with, and evaluate a multi-layer perceptron network
        python train.py hparams/mlp.yaml

        # Train, inference with, and evaluate a sequence-to-sequence network
        python train_s2s.py hparams/s2s_rnn.yaml
